## Features and setup ##

This template contains files needed to create a working PHP web contact form for Gmail API, and OAuth2 authorization. 

It includes these features:
1. Google Recaptcha
2. A list of spam deterrents. Some users may choose not to use some of these:
   - A hidden (honeypot) field that only bots would fill, and filling it causes an error
   - Submission timing - entering fields at non-human speeds will cause an error
   - Non-standard character filtering: Submissions with unsupported or foreign-language characters will cause an error. Not for everyone - consider your target audience.
   - URL filtering: URL entry is not allowed and will cause an error.
3. The form sends a copy of the form's contents to the sender, provided a valid email is entered.
4. Email format validation
5. Design and formatting (I tried to leave out all design additives to keep the page ultralight, but it's way too ugly without some of my favorites, IMO.):
    - Some Google fonts are loaded.
    - Bootstrap 5.3.6 is loaded, and some Bootstrap formatting is used.
    - AOS (Animate on Scroll) is loaded and provides some fade-in animations.
    - CSS file included (generated by a Sass scss file not provided
  
#### The main task of users of this form template: ####
- Fill in all required credentials in the `/assets/inc/config.php` file.
- Install Composer and the google/apiclient:^2.0 dependencies packages
- <em>Instructions are below, but further information may be required for those new to Composer, Google Cloud, etc.</em>

## Google Cloud, GMail API and OAuth2 Setup Checklist* ##

1. **Set up Google Cloud Project**
  - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) 
  - Create a new project (or select an existing one) 
  - Enable the **Gmail API** for your project 
  
2. **Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials** 
  - Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials** 
  - Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID 
    - Application type: **Web application** 
    - Add any domain or localhost URIs you’ll be testing from (e.g. `http://localhost`, `https://yourdomain.com`) 
  - Note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** 
  
3. **Obtain a Refresh Token** 
  - Visit the [OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/) 
  - Click the gear icon: 
    - Check **Use your own OAuth credentials** 
    - Paste your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** 
  - In Step 1 (column to the left), select or enter this scope in the field at the bottom of the list: `https://mail.google.com/` 
  - Authorize and allow Gmail access 
  - In Step 2, click **Exchange authorization code for tokens** 
  - Copy the **Refresh Token** 
    - The refresh token field disappears after a few seconds but that refresh token value is written near the bottom of the text displayed to the right.
   
4. **Set Up reCAPTCHA** 
  - Go to the [reCAPTCHA Admin Console](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin) 
  - Register your domain 
  - Choose **reCAPTCHA v2** (“I’m not a robot” checkbox) 
  - Add the `recaptcha_siteKey` and `recaptcha_secretKey` values to `config.php` 
  
5. **Configure your Project** 
  - Open `config.php` (included in this Gist – use the`config.php`file with spaces for credentials.) 
  - Fill in: 
    - `recaptcha_siteKey` (see steps below)
    - `recaptcha_secretKey`
    - `google_email` 
    - `oauth2_clientId` 
    - `oauth2_clientSecret` 
    - `oauth2_refreshToken` 
    - `senderEmail` 
    - `recipientEmail`

6. Install Composer if not already installed. See instructions below if necessary.
    
7. **Deploy and Test** 
  - NOTE: COMPOSER PACKAGES NEED TO BE INSTALLED BEFORE THIS - INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF NECESSARY
  - Upload the files to your server 
  - Ensure PHP can write to `form_debug.txt` 
  - Submit a test message (sending to your own email address is a good test)
  - Check Gmail **Sent** folder to confirm delivery </pre>

### Composer Setup Instructions ###

1. Install Composer (if not already installed):
  - Run this in your terminal: <pre>
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
</pre>

2. Navigate to your project folder: <pre>
  cd /path/to/contact-form-template</pre>
 
3. Create a composer.json file (already included in this template) 
  - If you're starting fresh<pre>
composer init</pre>

4. Require the Google API Client Library: <pre>
composer require google/apiclient:^2.0</pre>

5. Autoload in your PHP file (already done in contact.php):
  - At the top of your contact.php make sure you include (already included in this template.):<pre>
require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';</pre>

#### *OAuth2 credentials require a secure https:// domain in production. http://localhost is allowed for development only. See section below.

### How to enable HTTPS with Apache Use Let's Encrypt to install an SSL certificate (This is an Ubuntu/apt installation.)
  ``` 
  sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache 
  sudo certbot --apache 
  ``` 
  
  Follow the prompts to choose your domain and enable automatic redirects. More info: https://certbot.eff.org/
